# 📝 Exam-Gen: AI Question Paper Generator

**Exam-Gen** is an intelligent **Streamlit web application** designed to assist educators by automating the creation of diverse and well-structured exam papers.  
Powered by a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, this tool analyzes source documents (like textbook chapters or notes) and generates a **unique question paper with a detailed answer key** based on user-defined parameters.

This project moves beyond simple text generation to create a practical, real-world tool that saves educators hours of manual effort — ensuring **exam quality, fairness, and comprehensive syllabus coverage.**

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧩 **Multi-Document Support:** Upload multiple PDF files simultaneously to form a unified knowledge base for question generation.  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Exam Structure:** Full control over the exam’s composition — specify the exact number of questions for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 marks.  
- 🧠 **Intelligent Topic Diversity:** Automatically identifies main topics using BERTopic and cycles through them during generation to ensure topic balance.  
- 🔁 **Semantic Uniqueness Filter:** Prevents repetitive or similar questions by over-generating a pool and applying semantic similarity filtering to keep only unique ones.  
- 📄 **PDF Export:** Instantly download the generated **Question Paper** and **Answer Key** as separate, cleanly formatted PDF files.  
- 🖥️ **Modern & Intuitive UI:** A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for a seamless experience.

## 🏛️ System Architecture: The RAG Pipeline

Exam-Gen is built on a modern, multi-stage **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture that ensures all generated content is **factually grounded** in the provided material.

### 🔹 1. Ingestion & Processing
Extracts and chunks text from uploaded PDFs using PyMuPDF and LangChain’s text splitters.

### 🔹 2. Topic Modeling
Uses **BERTopic** to identify key themes, ensuring question diversity and topic coverage.

### 🔹 3. Embedding & Indexing
Converts text chunks into **semantic vectors** via Sentence-Transformers and stores them in **ChromaDB**, a lightweight vector database.

### 🔹 4. Intelligent Retrieval
Queries the vector store for the most relevant context using a **global topic cycler** to prevent topic lock-on.

### 🔹 5. Constrained Generation
Feeds the retrieved context into **Google Gemini LLM** with dynamically engineered prompts that adjust by mark value and complexity.

### 🔹 6. Uniqueness Filtering
Applies **cosine similarity filtering** to remove semantically similar questions.

### 🔹 7. PDF Output
Formats the final, curated questions and answers into **professional PDF documents** ready for distribution.
